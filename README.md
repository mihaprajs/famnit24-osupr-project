## Intro

The repository serves as a personal archive of all code written during the course of OSUPR at UP FAMNIT. The code is written in Java and R, using VS Code and Intellij Idea as the IDEs.

**FOR "I AM THE SMARTEST IDIOT" CLASSMATE(S): this IS NOT a free ride for your project.

## About Project

This is a project where I attempt to create AI application that could perform basic tasks outlined in [Nacrt.pdf](Nacrt.pdf). The AI was built using machine learning techniques, with a focus on training them to recognize patterns and provide responses based on user input. The project aimed to explore the fundamentals of AI, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, while applying theoretical knowledge to practical systems.

## Folder structure

1. Classification based on class type:
    - `class` - Contains code from lectures, that was written during the class
    - `practice` - Contains code from lab practice
    - `HW` - Contains homeworks

2. Organised code by dates (yyyy-mm-dd).

3. Optionally organised further to maintain a clean structure.
